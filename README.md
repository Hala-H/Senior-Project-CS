# Senior-Project-CS
My undergraduate senior project under the title: **Prediction of Childhood Obesity using Machine Learning in Saudi Arabia**.

## About
Childhood obesity causes several health problems. It is directly linked with causing obesity in the future and its health complications. However, applying intervention
on high risk children has proved to be an effective method of preventing obesity. Saudi Arabia, a country with increasing rates of obesity, should aim to reduce obesity prevalence to prevent future consequences. Prevention is better than cure is the main motivation for our work. In this project, we propose a solution using Machine Learning to predict childhood obesity in Saudi Arabia.

## Deployment using Streamlit
This application is built using a powerful Python library called Streamlit. According to the Streamlit Documentation, "Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science."

To ensure that our app runs on you system, you will have to install Streamlit.
<ol>
  <li> Make sure you have python installed in your system </li>
  <li> Use the following command (in a terminal) to install Streamlit </li>
  
    
    pip install Streamlit 
    
  
  <li> To run the app, you will need to follow the following steps: </li>
  <ol>
    <li> Open a terminal </li>
    <li> Change your directory to the directory where the Streamlit app is using the following command: </li> 
    
     cd 'directory path'  
    
   <li> Run the following command </li>
      
     streamlit run app.py 
      
  </ol>
  <li> When you the app, you start a web server that runs the interactive application on your local computer at http://localhost:8501. </li>
</ol>
